## üé® Project Structure and Customization

This portfolio's content and appearance are managed through its Svelte components and global CSS. Here's how you can easily customize it:

* **Content:**
    * Edit text in `About.svelte`, `Skills.svelte`, `Projects.svelte`, and `Contact.svelte` to reflect your personal details and content.
    * Update the `skills` array in `src/lib/components/Skills.svelte` with your specific technical stack.
    * Update the `projects` array in `src/lib/components/Projects.svelte` with your project details and links.
    * Modify `contactInfo` and `socialLinks` in `src/lib/components/Contact.svelte` with your personal contact and social media details.
    * Adjust the `sections` array in `src/routes/+layout.svelte` to match your desired navigation items and section IDs.
* **Theming:**
    * Adjust CSS variables in `src/app.css` to change colors, fonts, spacing, and shadows globally. Key variables include `--color-primary`, `--color-primary-accent`, `--color-background-main`, `--color-background-elevated`, and `--color-text-main`.
* **Icons:**
    * The `Skills.svelte` component loads SVG icons from the `static/svgs` folder. Ensure your SVG files are the correct and desired designs.
